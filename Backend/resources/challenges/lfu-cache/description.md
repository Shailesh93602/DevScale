# LFU Cache

Design and implement a data structure for a [Least Frequently Used (LFU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_frequently_used) cache.

Implement the `LFUCache` class:
- `LFUCache(int capacity)` Initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure.
- `int get(int key)` Gets the value of the `key` if the `key` exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns `-1`.
- `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if present, or inserts the `key` if not already present. When the cache reaches its `capacity`, it should invalidate and remove the **least frequently used** key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a **tie** (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the **least recently used** key would be invalidated.

To determine the least frequently used key, a **use counter** is maintained for each key in the cache. The key with the smallest **use counter** is the least frequently used key.

When a key is first inserted into the cache, its **use counter** is set to `1`. Any `get` or `put` operation on an existing key increments the **use counter**.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

### Example 1:
**Input:** `["LFUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]`
`[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [1], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]`
**Output:** `[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, 3, null, -1, 3, 4]`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= capacity <= 10^4`
- `0 <= key <= 10^5`
- `0 <= value <= 10^9`
- At most `2 * 10^5` calls will be made to `get` and `put`.
